usage.

 Example 01: This example is made to show you how you can use the Options.
 Example 02: an upload example.
 Example 03: verbose callback example.
 Example 04: GetInfo example.
 Example 05: Function functor for WriteFunction example.

 Example 07: Cookie interface example via getInfo.
             Demonstrates usage of Infos::CookieList which example04 did not.
 Example 08: verbose callback example, with exception safe handling.
 Example 09: verbose callback example, with exception safe handling,
